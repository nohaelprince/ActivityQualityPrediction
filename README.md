ActivityQualityPrediction
=========================

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions:

exactly according to the specification (Class A) throwing the elbows to the front (Class B) lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C) lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) throwing the hips to the front (Class E)

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.

The data for this project come from this source: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>

### The main objectives of this project are as follows

- Predict the manner in which they did the exercise.
- Build a prediction model.
- Calculate the out of sample error.
- Use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases provided.
